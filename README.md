#HTB-GUI

For the record this is a collection of programs and other tools that do not all belong to me. The main reason of this existing is for me to easily reflash linux machines for hack the box


This probably is bad and should not be used by anyone

Navigate to your downloaded directory and run sudo ./htb-setup.sh
This file might need to be made an executeable with chmod +x htb-setup.sh (in the file directory)

The setup will move the files to /usr/local/bin, so they are executeable from anywhere
Running the system auto config will set varibles in your system that allow you to shorten the wordlists 
this is to make life easier and only works with ZSH shell, There is also a backup located in the Bin Folder

The NMAP script and Gobuster script do not work. Learn it. 



For example:
 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt = $WL_rockyou
